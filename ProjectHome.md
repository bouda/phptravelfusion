TravelFusion.com offers comprehensive flight/fare and other bookable travel information from a wide array of sources via an XML API.  This project allows you to integrate their XML-based API into your PHP project.  In a sense, it is an API to an API.

The goal of this project is to provide a base-level of PHP functions to access the TravelFusion API, and it also provides a generic out-of-the-box, airline/fare search site using the TravelFusion data.

For more information on the TravelFusion API, visit:
